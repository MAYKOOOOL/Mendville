    text: "You caught me practicing. I was preparing for the Rodeo in Masbate. Long
      ago, I was a Rodeo champion. Every win helped me build this barn. With Elder
      Mendel\u2019s support, MendVille once had plenty of meat and livestock."

    text: But now, everything is gone. Illness took my animals, and supplies ran
      out. I thought maybe if I compete again, I could win livestock and restore
      this place.

    text: "I\u2019m not sure\u2026 but I do remember something. Aleng Merly has been
      struggling at her karenderya. With no pork, she can only cook vegetables now.
      Even her Bicol Express is no longer available."

      Supplying it again would help everyone."

    text: "Then pigs it must be. But not the kind that\u2019s all meat with barely
      any fat\u2026 folks here want pork that\u2019s rich, tender, and perfect for
      Bicol Express. That means Native pigs or Black pigs are what we need."
